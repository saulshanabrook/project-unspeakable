<h2>Magazine Articles</h2>
<p>The articles below by Randy Kehler and John Dear speak to why <em>Project Unspeakable </em>is relevant to our times. The article by James W. Douglass, A President for Peace, gives a history of how he came to write <a title="Orbis 50th anniv edition" href="http://www.orbisbooks.com/a-monthly-letter-from-orbis-books-editor-robert-ellsberg.html" target="_blank"><em>JFK and the Unspeakable: How He Died and Why It Matters</em></a>.</p>
<h2>&#8220;<b>Resisting the Lies that Make War Possible</b>&#8220;</h2>
<p>By Randy Kehler, to be published in the next issue of <em>The Progressive Populist </em>November 2013</p>
<p>The Greek dramatist Aeschylus wisely opined, “In war, truth is the first casualty.” And as we have seen, over and over again, when truth becomes a casualty, secrecy becomes the modus operandi, openness and transparency the enemy, government accountability a myth, and acts of conscience proof of treason.</p>
<p>This has been especially clear in recent times, in relation to Julian Assange, Chelsea (Bradley) Manning, Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras, Glen Greenwald, and others who have risked their lives to seek and speak the truth about the conduct of U.S. wars and military “operations,” and, more recently, about secret government surveillance programs that are often used as means to carry out these wars and covert operations.</p>
<p>One example of government crimes covered up by ongoing secrecy and lies that is now coming back into focus has to do with the assassination of President Kennedy.  November 22<sup>nd</sup> of this year marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Kennedy’s murder.</p>
<p>Although most Americans have long suspected government involvement, with the recent publication of James Douglass’ widely-acclaimed <em>JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters</em> (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010, pb)—based on ten years of meticulous research, including examination of government records not previously available to the public—their suspicions have been definitively confirmed.</p>
<p>However, it is perhaps the “why” of the book that is most surprising, and most important. While Kennedy was certainly no saint, as Douglass makes clear, and did begin his presidency as a “Cold Warrior,” he went through a dramatic and well-documented, yet unfortunately little known, shift in his thinking.</p>
<p>This shift resulted, in large part, from his loathing of the CIA for having tried, unsuccessfully, to trap him into supporting their disastrous “Bay of Pigs” invasion of Cuba in 1961 and his horror during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 when his generals and national security staff were prepared to launch an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>These crises and several other, related developments caused him to fire the head of the CIA, the powerful Allen Dulles; initiate back-channel communication with Fidel Castro aimed at defusing the U.S.-Cuba hostility; initiate a secret and well-documented correspondence with his “arch enemy” Nikita Khruschev (in which both men acknowledged that their military leaders were driving them toward nuclear war and that each needed the other’s help to avert it); propose in his famous American University speech of June 1963 that the nuclear arms race be wound down and the Cold War ended; and order the withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. military personnel from Vietnam by the end of 1963 and “the bulk of U.S. personnel… by the end of 1965” (an order that was rescinded shortly after his assassination).</p>
<p>In short, Kennedy was at complete odds—one might say he was at war—with the Pentagon, the CIA, and virtually his whole national security staff.  And he was refusing to back down.  In retrospect, the “why” of his assassination is obvious.</p>
<p>Although there isn’t space here to go into it, further reading and study has persuaded me that the three other assassinations of influential leaders that followed in the wake of the JFK assassination—of Malcolm X (February 1965), Martin Luther King, Jr. (April 1968), and Robert Kennedy (June 1968)—also had the fingerprints of the U.S. national security apparatus all over them.</p>
<p>But what to do about all this?  Fortunately, Massachusetts actor, theater director, and playwright Court Dorsey has come up with one thing many of us can do. He has written a brilliant play called <i>Project Unspeakable</i> that deals with all four 1960’s assassinations and their relevance for today.  His hope is that the play will “go viral” —a-la-plays like <i>The Laramie Project, My Name Is Rachel Corrie,</i> and <i>The Vagina Monologues. </i></p>
<p>Thanks in part to<i> Project Unspeakable’s</i> growing list of endorsers (which includes Eve Ensler, Medea Benjamin, Daniel Ellsberg, Joanna Macy, and Martin Sheen), readings or performances of the play have already been lined up for November 22<sup>nd</sup> in dozens of cities and towns all over the country.  Additional readings and performances are encouraged throughout 2014 and into early 2015, on the birth or assassination dates of one of the four slain leaders.  [For further information and to request a copy of the script, go to <a href="http://www.projectunspeakable.com">www.projectunspeakable.com</a>.]</p>
<p>It is further hoped that <i>Project Unspeakable</i> will stimulate awareness and vigorous discussion not only about what happened 50 years ago, but, more importantly, about what’s happening <i>now </i>in terms of the machinations, secrets, and lies of the same, though ever more powerful, “national security state” and its corporate allies—thus helping all of us begin to break through the deadening silence of the “unspeakable” and resist the secrets and lies that make war and other crimes possible.</p>

<h2>JFK and &#8220;Project Unspeakable&#8221;</h2>
<p>By John Dear, <a title="NCR John Dear" href="http://ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/assassination-john-f-kennedy-and-project-unspeakable" target="_blank">National Catholic Reporter 11.19.13</a></p>
<p>This weekend, thousands of us will converge on Columbus, Georgia, for the annual protest at the “School of the Americas,” the official U.S. military training institution for Latin American militaries and death squads. Once again, we will mourn the dead, march for peace, and call for the closing of this terrorist training camp. [See: <a title="http://www.soaw.org/" href="http://www.soaw.org/" target="_blank">www.soaw.org</a>]</p>
<p>But Friday, November 22nd, of course, marks the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination. On Friday afternoon, at the Columbus Convention Center, I will take part in the premiere of “Project Unspeakable,” a theatrical production based on Jim Douglass’ exceptional book<i>, JFK and the Unspeakable: How He Died and Why It Matters</i> (Simon and Schuster/paper).</p>
<p>Like the “Laramie Project,” “Project Unspeakable” (by Court Dorsey, see <a href="www.projectunspeakable.com">www.projectunspeakable.com</a>) can be read by a dozen people and staged by activist groups around the country as a tool for political education and discussion. The goal is to use live political theater to break the silence and propaganda around the assassinations of the Kennedys, Malcolm X, and Dr. King, and to show how and why U.S. government and military forces systemically killed our best leaders.</p>
<p>On Friday, Jim Douglass, Randy Kehler, Kathy Kelly and I will be among the readers. As we mark this anniversary, I certainly urge people to read Jim’s book&#8211;the best book on the assassination, perhaps the best book on a U.S. president, and one of the best books which explains these last fifty years of war and corruption.</p>
<p>Jim Douglass uses the writings of his friend Trappist monk Thomas Merton as a sounding board of faith and reason throughout the story.</p>
<p>“One of the awful facts of our age,” Merton wrote in 1965, “is the evidence that the world is stricken indeed, stricken to the very core of its being by the presence of the Unspeakable. Those who are so eager to be reconciled with the world at any price must take care not to be reconciled with it under this particular aspect: as the nest of the Unspeakable. This is what too few are willing to see.”</p>
<p>The Unspeakable, Merton wrote, “is the void that contradicts everything that is spoken even before the words are said, the void that gets into the language of public and official declarations at the very moment when they are pronounced, and makes them ring dead with the hollowness of the abyss. It is the void out of which Eichmann drew the punctilious exactitude of his obedience.”</p>
<p>Put another way, Merton’s term “the Unspeakable,” refers to the systemic evil and its darkness and shadow that surrounds us today. It’s the structures, institutions and spirit of violence, war and evil that run rampant across the globe. If we open our eyes, we see it everywhere—from the Snowden revelations that our government is spying and tracking possibly every human being on the planet to our secret wars and extrajudicial assassinations, the drone bombings, the loss of civil liberties, the total sell-out to corporations and weapons manufacturers, the ongoing preparations for nuclear war, the failure to serve the poor at home and abroad—not to mention our destruction of the environment and active pursuit of catastrophic climate change.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, the Unspeakable meant the “war on communism,” the active pursuit of global nuclear war, and war with Cuba, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam. By punishing, silencing, and killing off the voices of truth, this Unspeakable evil pursued its warpath in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Colombia, and then the war on terrorism and the U.S. killings in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Through meticulous research, Jim Douglass argues that JFK began to understand our systemic commitment to war and nuclear weapons, and decided to confront it. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, probably the most dangerous moment in human history, we came perilously close to killing millions of people in a nuclear conflagration. But JFK, with Khrushchev, choose peace instead. Then he began to take small steps to reverse our nuclear buildup and pull our troops out of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Indeed, Douglass argues that because of JFK’s ongoing bad health, near-death experience on PT 109, and eyewitness experience at the failed founding of the League of Nations, JFK had always been determined to give his life for peace, to help prevent another world war. He paid for his pursuit of peace with his very life.</p>
<p>“The Unspeakable is not far away,” Jim Douglass writes in a quote we will cite in Friday’s performance. “It is not somewhere out there, identical with a government that became foreign to us. The emptiness of the void, the vacuum of responsibility and compassion, is in ourselves. Our citizen denial provides the ground for the government’s doctrine of ‘plausible deniability.’</p>
<p>Kennedy’s assassination is rooted in our denial of our nation’s crimes in World War II that began the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. As a growing precedent to JFK’s assassination by his own national security state, we U.S. citizens supported our government when it destroyed whole cities (Hamburg, Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki), when it protected our Cold War security by world-destructive weapons, and when it carried out the covert murders of foreign leaders with ‘plausible deniability’ in a way that was obvious to critical observers. By avoiding our responsibility for the escalating crimes of state done for our security, we who failed to confront the Unspeakable opened the door to JFK’s assassination and its cover-up.</p>
<p>In his book, Jim Douglass asks “Why was JFK killed?” That’s a question few dare to ask. If we pursue the truth, he insists that we will find hope even in the darkness. “Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit,” Jesus says in John’s Gospel (12:24). In that spirit, Douglass writes:</p>
<p><em> What Jesus was all about, what we as human beings are all about in our deepest nature, is giving our lives for one another. By bearing that witness of martyrdom, he taught, we will come to know what humanity really is in its glory, on earth as it is in heaven. A martyr is therefore a living witness to our new humanity. Was John F. Kennedy a martyr, one who in spite of contradictions gave his life as witness to a new, more peaceful humanity? Did a president of the United States, while in command of total nuclear war, detach himself enough from its power to give his life for peace?&#8230; Kennedy was not naïve. He knew the forces he was up against. Is it even conceivable that a man with such power in his hands could have laid it down and turned toward an end to the Cold War, in the knowledge he would then be, in Merton’s phrase, marked out for assassination?</em></p>
<p>“Peace need not be impractical, and war need not be inevitable,” JFK said famously at American“Peace need not be impractical, and war need not be inevitable,” JFK said famously at American University a few months before those government forces killed him. He called for “a strategy of peace,” not “a strategy of annihilation.” “Is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights—the right to live out our lives without fear of devastation—the right to breathe air as nature provided it—the right of future generations to a healthy existence?”</p>
<p>“Let us step back from the shadows of war and seek out the way of peace,” JFK said that summer. “And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step.”</p>
<p>I believe with Jim Douglass that JFK’s steps toward peace cost him his life, as similar steps ended the lives of Malcolm X, Dr. King and RFK. But if we enter the story of the nonviolent Jesus and see with the eyes of truth as Merton and Jim Douglass do, we can find the good fruit that comes from their lives, and new courage to “seek out the way of peace” today.</p>
<p>That’s what “Project Unspeakable” attempts to do&#8212;to look deep into the Unspeakable darkness of fifty years ago, a darkness that still grips our land, and in a spirit of truth and compassion, find the wisdom and strength to renew our journey to peace and truth.</p>
<p>“If we go as far as we can into the darkness, regardless of the consequences,” Jim Douglass writes, “I believe a midnight truth will free us from our bondage to violence and bring us to the light of peace.”</p>
<p>I hope this 50th anniversary will inspire us to pursue the truth and deepen the struggle to close the  “SOA,” as well as the struggles to end drone warfare, government surveillance, systemic injustice, U.S. warmaking, and environmental destruction, so that one day future generations might be freed of violence and live in the light of justice, peace and nonviolence.</p>

<h2>A President for Peace: The Deadly Consequences of JFK&#8217;s Attempts at Reconciliation</h2>
<p>by James Douglass, <a title="Douglass America magazine" href="http://americamagazine.org/issue/president-peace" target="_blank">America magazine </a>November 6, 2013</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The day President John F. Kennedy was murdered, a Divine Word seminarian walked up the hill to our family’s apartment in Rome to tell my wife Sally and me the terrible news. Seeking wisdom, I wrote Dorothy Day, who had stayed with us the previous spring on a pilgrimage to Rome to thank Pope John XXIII for “Pacem in Terris” (1963), his landmark encyclical on global peace and human rights.</p>
<p>Dorothy wrote back saying I should pay attention to Kennedy’s life by reading a profile on him she recommended. She said that in a context of continuing violence, she would pray <i>to</i> John F. Kennedy (her emphasis). And she encouraged reflection on St. Paul’s words: “For those who love God, all things work together unto good” (Rm 8:28).</p>
<p>In November 1963 I was in my first full year in Rome lobbying bishops at the Second Vatican Council to condemn total war and support conscientious objection. Inspired by Pope John’s plea for mutual trust between cold war rivals, I had written in The Catholic Worker newspaper that Kennedy should have resolved the Cuban missile crisis by a (politically unthinkable) exchange of missile bases with Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier.</p>
<p>At that time I had no idea Kennedy had taken that leap secretly with Khrushchev while also pledging publicly never to invade Cuba, which infuriated his Joint Chiefs of Staff. By his turn to peace with our Communist enemies, proclaimed on June 10, 1963, in his commencement address at American University, Kennedy risked his life, according to a contingent prophecy by Thomas Merton. In January 1962 Merton wrote to a friend and expressed “little confidence” in Kennedy’s ability to escape the nuclear crisis, since Kennedy did not have the necessary depth, humanity, self-forgetfulness and compassion. “Maybe Kennedy will break through into that some day by miracle,” Merton wrote. “But such people are before long marked out for assassination.”</p>
<h4>Internal Opposition</h4>
<p>Three decades later, I finally took Dorothy Day seriously by researching Kennedy’s life and death. For 12 years I studied national security documents on his crises during the cold war, especially those declassified by Congress through the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. I traced and interviewed witnesses to his assassination. I began to see the redemptive light of Dallas that Dorothy sensed in November 1963 through her love of God.</p>
<p>Seeking light in a depth of systemic evil that Merton called “the Unspeakable,” which he described in <i>Raids on the Unspeakable</i> (1966), leads one to a Gospel story. Kennedy was learning to see through the eyes of his Communist adversaries. At great personal risk, he was turning from war to peacemaking. I was astounded by the grace-filled story of a president of the United States choosing peace—at the cost of his life.</p>
<p>The darkness of Kennedy’s assassination extends back to the Cuban missile crisis at a meeting on Oct. 19, 1962, when Kennedy refused the pressures of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to bomb and invade Cuba. When he left the room, a hidden tape recorder kept running, capturing the chiefs’ disdain for the president and their determination to escalate the conflict to total nuclear war. They wanted to win the cold war.</p>
<p>Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, chief of staff of the Air Force, carried out that intention. In the midst of the crisis, he ordered nuclear-armed bombers beyond their usual turnaround points toward the Soviet Union and test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile—steps designed to provoke the Soviets to react, which would trigger an all-out nuclear attack by superior U.S. forces. Fortunately the Soviets did not take the bait.</p>
<p>The darkness of Dallas goes back even further to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 by Cuban exiles trained by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. In retrospect, Kennedy realized the C.I.A. had deceived him by claiming the imminence of a popular Cuban revolt against Fidel Castro and that the exile brigade could “go guerrilla.” They had tried to trap the president into authorizing an invasion by U.S. combat forces to save the day. Kennedy, however, had the courage to take the loss. As he later told friends, “They couldn’t believe that a new president like me wouldn’t panic and try to save his own face. Well, they had me figured all wrong.” Kennedy was furious at the C.I.A. over the incident. The New York Times later reported that Kennedy told one of the highest officials in his administration that he wanted “to splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.”</p>
<p>In fact, the president had fired C.I.A. Director Allen Dulles and his deputies, Richard M. Bissell Jr., and Gen. Charles P. Cabell. Mr. Dulles was arguably the most powerful man involved in the cold war. He returned to power as a member of the Warren Commission, steering it to the lone-assassin conclusion it issued in its report in 1964 about the president’s murder.</p>
<h4>Building a Relationship</h4>
<p>In the missile crisis, Kennedy turned toward peace. At the height of the terrifying conflict his own anti-Castro policies helped precipitate, he sought a way out. Kennedy chose a route his generals thought unforgiveable. He not only rejected their pressures to attack Cuba and the Soviet Union. Even worse, the president reached out to the enemy for help. That could be considered treason. Khrushchev saw it as a sign of hope.</p>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general, had met secretly on Oct. 27, 1962, with the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, in Washington, warning that the U.S. president was losing control to his generals and needed the Soviets’ help. When Khrushchev received Kennedy’s plea in Moscow, he turned to his foreign minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, and said, “We have to let Kennedy know that we want to help him.” Khrushchev hesitated at the thought of helping his enemy, but repeated: “Yes, help. We now have a common cause, to save the world from those pushing us toward war.”</p>
<p>How can we understand that moment? The two most heavily armed leaders in history, on the verge of total nuclear war, suddenly joined hands against those on both sides pressuring them to attack. Khrushchev ordered the immediate withdrawal of his missiles in return for Kennedy’s public pledge never to invade Cuba and his secret promise to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey—as he would in fact do. The two cold war enemies had turned; each leader now had more in common with his opponent than with his own generals.</p>
<p>Neither John F. Kennedy nor Nikita Khrushchev was a saint. Each was deeply complicit in policies that brought humankind to the brink of nuclear war. But when they encountered what Thomas Merton identified as “the void of the Unspeakable,” they turned to each other for help. In doing so, they turned humanity toward the hope of a peaceful planet.</p>
<p>The genesis of the Kennedy-Khrushchev turnaround during the missile crisis was their secret correspondence, which began over a year earlier. After their failed meeting in Vienna in June 1961, Khrushchev wrote a groundbreaking letter to the president, dated Sept. 29, 1961. To convey the heart of his message, the Communist leader used a biblical analogy: Khrushchev compared his and Kennedy’s situation with Noah’s Ark. In the letter he wrote: in Noah’s Ark “both the ‘clean’ and the ‘unclean’ found sanctuary. But regardless of who lists himself with the ‘clean’ and who is considered to be ‘unclean,’ they are all equally interested in one thing, and that is that the Ark should successfully continue its cruise. And we have no other alternative: either we should live in peace and cooperation so that the Ark maintains its buoyancy, or else it sinks.”</p>
<p>Kennedy replied on Oct. 16: “I like very much your analogy of Noah’s Ark, with both the ‘clean’ and the ‘unclean’ determined that it stay afloat.”</p>
<p>Thus, through their secret correspondence, the two men struggled to achieve a better understanding of each other and their differences. The Cuban missile crisis a year later was proof they had not resolved their conflicts. Yet it was thanks especially to the secret letters that each knew the other as a human being he could respect. They also knew they had once agreed warmly that the world was an Ark. They had to keep the Ark afloat. And they did, at its most perilous moment.</p>
<h4>Seeking Peace Together</h4>
<p>Once Kennedy and Khrushchev turned together in the missile crisis, they began conspiring for peace. The breakthrough was Kennedy’s address in June 1963 at American University. By introducing his vision of peace as a response to the Russians’ suffering in World War II, Kennedy bridged the gap with the enemy. Khrushchev later told the American diplomat W. Averell Harriman that it was “the greatest speech by any American president since Roosevelt.”</p>
<p>Kennedy’s announcement at the university of his unilateral cessation of atmospheric nuclear tests and his expressed hope for treaty negotiations in Moscow opened the door. Within six weeks, he and Khrushchev signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It was a confirming sign of their joint decision to end the cold war.</p>
<p>Another sign was Nikita Khrushchev’s counsel to Fidel Castro that he should begin to work with John F. Kennedy. Castro had been furious with Khrushchev for withdrawing his missiles at the 11th hour of the crisis without consulting his Cuban ally, in return for only a promise from a capitalist. Khrushchev, however, wrote a peaceful, reconciling letter to Castro on Jan. 31, 1963, that corresponded to his Noah’s Ark letter to Kennedy. Castro accepted his invitation to come to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Castro made that visit to Khrushchev from May to June 1963. The two leaders traveled together around the Soviet Union. Castro said later that Khrushchev gave him a tutorial on their joint need to trust Kennedy. Day after day, Khrushchev read aloud to Castro his correspondence with Kennedy, emphasizing the hope for peace they now had by working with the U.S. president.</p>
<p>Khrushchev was practicing what Pope John, whom the Communist leader had come to love, recommended in “Pacem in Terris,” where he wrote: “True and lasting peace among nations cannot consist in the possession of an equal supply of armaments but only in mutual trust.” The pope had sent Khrushchev a papal medal and a pre-publication copy in Russian of the peace encyclical. Khrushchev was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>In September 1963, Kennedy took another giant step toward mutual trust as the new basis for peace. He initiated a secret dialogue with Fidel Castro, through the U.S./United Nations diplomat William Attwood, to normalize U.S.-Cuban relations. Castro responded with enthusiasm and began to make secret arrangements for a meeting with Attwood. Kennedy jump-started the process by using a back channel to communicate with Castro. His unofficial representative, the French reporter Jean Daniel, was meeting for the second time with Castro on the afternoon of Nov. 22, 1963, when they heard the news of the president’s death. Castro stood up, looked at Daniel, and said, “Everything is changed. Everything is going to change.” The U.S.-Cuban dialogue died in Dallas.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, Kennedy also moved to end U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. National Security Action Memorandum No. 263, issued on Oct. 11, 1963, says that at a meeting six days earlier Kennedy approved a program to train Vietnamese, so that the United States would be able to “withdraw 1,000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963,” and “by the end of 1965…the bulk of U.S. personnel.” President Lyndon B. Johnson quietly ignored these plans. The Vietnam War reignited in Dallas.</p>
<h4>Rendezvous With Death</h4>
<p>Kennedy’s courageous turn from global war to a strategy of peace provides the why of his assassination. Given the cold war dogmas of his government and his own turn toward peace, Kennedy’s murder followed as a matter of course. It was a transparent act of state, which leaves us in the end with a transforming hope.</p>
<p>Hope? How does one discover hope from the murder of a president who was turning from war to peace?</p>
<p>By confronting the Unspeakable in our history, we can see a redemptive light in the darkness. Pressured relentlessly to wage war, Kennedy ordered his government after the missile crisis to pursue a policy of “general and complete disarmament” (see N.S.A. Memorandum No. 239, May 6, 1963). The president’s courageous turnaround and his willingness to die for peace is what spoiled the C.I.A.’s and Joint Chiefs’ determination to win the cold war in the only way they knew. This conversion and sacrifice saved us all from a nuclear wasteland. We still have a chance. But are we willing to turn toward peace, accepting the cost?</p>
<p>Through almost constant illness, John F. Kennedy had been listening to the music of death for years. His favorite poem was “I Have a Rendezvous With Death,” by Alan Seeger. Jacqueline Kennedy taught the poem to their 5-year-old daughter, Caroline. On a beautiful day in October 1963, during a meeting with national security advisers in the Rose Garden, Caroline gained her father’s attention. She looked into his eyes and recited the poem, which ends:</p>
<div><em>But I’ve a rendezvous with Death</em></div>
<div><em>At midnight in some flaming town</em></div>
<div><em>When Spring trips north again this year,</em></div>
<div><em>And I to my pledged word am true,</em></div>
<div><i>I shall not fail that rendezvous.</i></div>
<p>On a midnight flight from Vienna after his meeting with Khrushchev two years earlier, Kennedy had written on a slip of paper a favorite saying of his from Abraham Lincoln:</p>
<div><em>I know there is a God—and I see a storm coming;</em></div>
<div><i>If he has a place for me, I believe that I am ready.</i></div>
<p>The storm he feared was nuclear war. If God had a place for him—a rendezvous with death—that might help avert that storm on humanity, he believed that he was ready. He would not fail that rendezvous.</p>
