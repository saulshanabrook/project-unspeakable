Born in Lansing, Michigan on January 5, 1948 to Frank Hubert and Frieda Eva (Guttmann) Mather, Lenny retained a strong affection for Michigans Upper Peninsula: the town of L&#8217;Anse where he lived for a number of years, the family home in Keweenaw Bay, and Lake Superior which Lenny always called Gitche Gumee, its Ojibwe name. An admirer of the comedian Lenny Bruce, Frank went by the name of Lenny Mather for all the years he lived in the Boston area. In the 60s at Michigan State University Frank Mather became an anti-war activist and an early member of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society). A politically savvy researcher Lenny spent all his adult life educating himself and others about the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X. In 1993 on the 30th anniversary of JFK&#8217;s death, he helped organize a conference at\u00a0<a id=\"InlineMicrositeLink_Harvard\" class=\"MicrositeKeyword\" title=\"Visit Harvard Memorial Site to see similar profiles\" href=\"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/memorial-sites\/harvard-university\/?personid=190876945&amp;affiliateID=2658\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard University<\/a>\u00a0about JFK&#8217;s assassination attended by many notable authors and Marina Oswald Porter. In 2010 Lenny organized a talk at the Harvard- Epworth Church for Jim Douglass, the author of &#8220;JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters&#8221;. In November 2017 Lenny participated in a community reading at UMass Boston of Court Dorsey&#8217;s play, &#8220;Project Unspeakable&#8221; based on the Douglass book. Frank Hubert &#8220;Lenny&#8221; Mather is survived by one sister, Robin Mather Nagel of Oakland, California, two nephews Daniel (Letitia) Nagel of Vista, CA, and Benno Nagel, of Oakland, CA.

That was the plight of our friend, Lenny Mather, a boundlessly energetic organizer for enlightenment and liberation on issues that will determine whether humankind lives or dies&#8230;but with nowhere to lay his own head for so many of his days&#8230;perhaps necessarily so to be Lenny.<\/p>\n<p>I met Lenny in person the night of the Cambridge talk he organized that Randy has described in his beautiful reflection on our brother. I don&#8217;t think that event would have happened at all without Lenny&#8217;s endless energy, contacts, and work &#8212; whose organizing details I heard about from him during many phone calls, Boston-to-Birmingham, in the preceding weeks. What I recall most about Lenny after the talk that night was not so much the late-night conversation but one the two of us resumed in the very early morning. Or to be more specific, one he resumed from his sleeping bag on the floor in the pre-dawn hours, letting me know on the other side of the room that it was time to talk about Bob Dylan. We spent hours exploring Dylan&#8217;s life and music until the day broke, a subject Lenny was as fervent about as he was about JFK and 9\/11.<\/p>\n<p>Lenny and I remained in long-distance touch by periodic phone calls through the years. Lenny would call from a cafe where he hung out while doing his organizing &#8212; with his laptop computer vanishing when he occasionally took his eyes off it. He was always scrambling at the end of those days for an attic, a garage, a friend&#8217;s couch &#8212; some place where he could lay down his head. He was always enthusiastic about whatever project he was working on and encouraged me deeply in my work.<\/p>\n<p>I would only see him one more time, briefly at a JFK conference in Dallas. He stayed on after I returned to Birmingham. My last painful memory of Lenny is that I heard by phone from a friend in Dallas that he was looking for a place to stay overnight other than a bus or train station before his departure. By a discouraging remark, I may have kept her from helping him. I believe in our continuing communion with our elders who have passed. I ask Lenny&#8217;s forgiveness for that night.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how Lenny managed to be who he was and do what he did, as a joyful, pain-in-the-neck organizer for what he envisioned for us all, but without a place to rest his own head &#8212; until he found one in the last stage of his life, thanks to the deep kindness of a friend. Somewhere along the way, maybe at the point when he decided his name would be &#8220;Lenny&#8221; after Lenny Bruce, I think our friend made the choice to be as free as he could be, to do the freeing work he felt called to do. He suffered through the consequences.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, Lenny could be a pain, but he endured an awful lot of it. I&#8217;m deeply grateful for having known him. And for knowing his inspiring presence now. He was a gutsy, spirit-filled, beautiful guy &#8212; a true son of humanity in what he felt and saw from his heart, lived out on the streets, and endured through his life for the sake of a better life and world for us all.<\/p>\n<p>Gratitude, love, and peace to him and to you all,<\/p>\n<p>Jim Douglass<br \/>\nSunday, November 11, 2018<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #dc0000;\">Statement from Randy Kehler<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Dear friends,<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m very sorry not to be able to be with you today to pay tribute to our dear friend Lenny. I say \u201cdear friend\u201d because Lenny really did seem like a dear friend, even though he and I only met, in person, once.<\/p>\n<p>We had met by phone, however.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d been given his name \u2013 or perhaps he\u2019d been given mine \u2013 when I was organizing a New England speaking tour for Jim Douglass, the author of the then recently published and already much-acclaimed (as well as, of course, ridiculed and dismissed)\u00a0<u>JFK and the Unspeakable<\/u>\u00a0\u2013 a book all of you here today are, no doubt, familiar with.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d been told &#8212; perhaps by Jim, or maybe by someone I knew in the Boston area who knew Lenny \u2013 that Lenny would probably be willing to help organize a talk for Jim in Cambridge.\u00a0\u00a0And he was &#8212; immediately, without hesitation\u00a0\u00a0He was not only\u00a0<em>willing,<\/em>\u00a0but effusively\u00a0<em>enthusiastic.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0Which made me take a liking to him right away.<\/p>\n<p>You won\u2019t be surprised to hear that Lenny actually did much more than \u201chelp.\u201d As far as I could tell, based on our many long (<em>very<\/em>\u00a0long and always very animated) phone conversations prior to the event &#8212;\u00a0\u00a0which, by the way, took place at the Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church on Mass Avenue, on Friday evening, October 1<sup>st<\/sup>, 2010 &#8212; he was the primary \u201cmover and shaker\u201d responsible for making it happen. He had help from some of his fellow members of the Greater Boston Alliance for 911 Truth and Justice, but as far as I could tell he did at least 90% of the work.<\/p>\n<p>With every ensuing phone conversation we had prior to October 1<sup>st<\/sup>, Lenny filled me in on more and more ideas he had for promoting the event, all of which he followed through on &#8212; including posters all around Cambridge and in key places in Boston, flyers passed out a local events, spots on local radio stations, information sent to potentially sympathetic organizations, and a nearly full-page ad in the\u00a0<em>Harvard Crimson<\/em>\u00a0just before Jim\u2019s talk.<\/p>\n<p>As an organizer myself, I was really impressed and couldn\u2019t help but wonder who this Lenny guy was &#8212; this incredibly enthusiastic, energetic, seemingly indefatiguable, non-stop-talking, super-organizer-of-a-guy.<\/p>\n<p>The event went well, by the way, although we were disappointed by the scant turn-out of Harvard and other college-age students.\u00a0\u00a0In retrospect, probably no surprise.<\/p>\n<p>After the event was over, a number of us from out of town, including Jim, walked over to the staff residence of Cambridge Friends Meeting on nearby Longfellow Park where John Bach and his wife, the resident staff, had offered to put us up for the night. Lenny asked if he could join us, so that we could de-brief the event. We said \u201csure,\u201d and he came along &#8212; talking all the way, of course.<\/p>\n<p>Then, once we\u2019d arrived, he asked if he could spend the night there with us; he said he could be happy sleeping on the floor or a couch. When we asked where his home was, he said he didn\u2019t have one, that he was \u201chomeless\u201d and lived \u201con the streets,\u201d spending nights wherever someone would put him up. I was stunned to hear that, having assumed that anyone as experienced an organizer and as obviously well-connected as he was &#8212; not to mention someone well into \u201cmiddle age\u201d \u2013 could be \u201chomeless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It turned out to be a long, late night, with Lenny keeping the conversation going &#8212; and us awake! &#8212; till well after midnight, mostly by peppering Jim with a million questions related to Jim\u2019s years of research for his JFK book.<\/p>\n<p>The next morning Lenny joined us for a quick breakfast at a nearby eating place on Mass Ave., where, of course, he once again engaged us in non-stop, fast-moving, animated conversation.\u00a0\u00a0And then Jim and I took off for Jim\u2019s next speaking engagement \u2013 in Weston, Vermont, I think.<\/p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t see Lenny again, or have any contact with him, until one evening in Amherst two or three years later.\u00a0\u00a0We were in the brand new auditorium of the Amherst Junior High School where our\u00a0<em>Project Unspeakable<\/em>\u00a0was staging a dramatic reading of Court Dorsey\u2019s exciting, theatrical script about the assassinations of JFK, Malcolm, Martin, and RFK, based on Jim\u2019s book.\u00a0It was a packed house, a great evening.<\/p>\n<p>At the end, after I stood up and made my usual pitch for donations to support the\u00a0<em>Project\u2019s<\/em>\u00a0work, who should come up to me with a big grin and give me a big hug but, of course, Lenny!\u00a0\u00a0He said, \u201cRandy, do you remember me?\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m Lenny!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I immediately remembered him, and we had a great, but all-too-short conversation.\u00a0\u00a0He said he\u2019d heard about the Amherst reading and had hitched a ride with someone he knew who was coming out from Cambridge for it (or, more likely, someone he\u00a0<em>persuaded<\/em>\u00a0to come out for it.)<\/p>\n<p>His greeting really touched my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll never forget that wonderfully endearing moment.\u00a0\u00a0I only wish that Lenny and I had somehow stayed in touch, before then, and after.\u00a0\u00a0Despite all his eccentricities and craziness, he was clearly a great soul.\u00a0And it makes me sad that he is no longer with us.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, everyone, for being here today to celebrate him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Frank Lenny Hubert Mather died in Cambridge on June 14, 2018 of natural causes.

Douglas Wilson, member of the Core Group of Project Unspeakable<\/span><\/em><\/h4>\n<p>Having read JFK and the Unspeakable several years ago, I\u2019ve been thinking about assassinations for quite a while and I\u2019ve seen how \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is used to shut off debate, to signal that we\u2019re entering \u201cthe unspeakable\u201d zone. So I began to wonder if the use of the term Conspiracy Theory might be a conspiracy itself.<\/p>\n<p>So I went exploring, and surprise surprise, there is a 1967 CIA memo that puts forward a great many of the commonly heard rebuttals to the Warren Commission Report. The CIA owned over 250 media outlets in the 1960s, spent close to a billion dollars (in today\u2019s dollars) spreading information, and had people doing its bidding in every major city in the world, so it is not surprising that they were able to disseminate this idea.<\/p>\n<p>And the issue is contemporary, too, not just historical.  Cass Sunstein is a powerful Obama Administration insider whose new book, Conspiracy Theories and Other Dangerous Ideas, is a sophisticated apology for the established order.<\/p>\n<p>The last of this series of articles is the CIA 1967 memo itself.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><div id=\"panel-657-0-0-1\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_black-studio-tinymce widget_black_studio_tinymce\" data-index=\"1\" ><h3 class=\"widget-title\">CIA Document 1035-960: Foundation of a Weaponized Term<\/h3><div class=\"textwidget\"><h3><em><span style=\"color: #808080;\">from <\/span><\/em><a title=\"Memory Hole Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/memoryholeblog.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Memory Hole<\/span><\/span><\/a><em><span style=\"color: #808080;\">: Reflections on Media and Politics<\/span><\/em><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">\u00a9 Memory Hole Blog \/ James F.

Since the 1960s the label has become a disciplinary device that has been overwhelmingly effective in defining certain events off limits to inquiry or debate. Especially in the United States raising legitimate questions about dubious official narratives destined to inform public opinion (and thereby public policy) is a major thought crime that must be cauterized from the public psyche at all costs.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-658 \" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/CIA.jpg\" alt=\"CIA\" width=\"280\" height=\"180\" \/>Conspiracy theory\u2019s acutely negative connotations may be traced to liberal historian Richard Hofstadter\u2019s well-known fusillades against the \u201cNew Right.\u201d Yet it was the Central Intelligence Agency that likely played the greatest role in effectively \u201cweaponizing\u201d the term. In the groundswell of public skepticism toward the Warren Commission\u2019s findings on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the CIA sent a detailed directive to all of its bureaus. Titled \u201c<em><a title=\"JFK Lancer\" href=\"http:\/\/www.jfklancer.com\/CIA.html\" target=\"_blank\">Countering Criticism of the Warren Commission Report<\/a><\/em>,\u201d the dispatch played a definitive role in making the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d term a weapon to be wielded against almost any individual or group calling the government\u2019s increasingly clandestine programs and activities into question.<\/p>\n<p>This important memorandum and its broad implications for American politics and public discourse are detailed in a book by Florida State University political scientist Lance deHaven-Smith, <a title=\"University of Texas Press\" href=\"http:\/\/www.utexas.edu\/utpress\/books\/dehcon.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Conspiracy Theory in America<\/em><\/a>. Dr. deHaven-Smith devised the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectcensored.org\/state-crimes-democracy\/\" target=\"_blank\">state crimes against democracy<\/a> concept to interpret and explain potential government complicity in events such as the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the major political assassinations of the 1960s, and 9\/11.<\/p>\n<p>CIA Document 1035-960 was released in response to a 1976 FOIA request by the New York Times. The directive is especially significant because it outlines the CIA\u2019s concern regarding \u201cthe whole reputation of the American government\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis the Warren Commission Report. The agency was especially interested in maintaining its own image and role as it \u201ccontributed information to the [Warren] investigation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The memorandum lays out a detailed series of actions and techniques for \u201ccountering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries.\u201d For example, approaching \u201cfriendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors)\u201d to remind them of the Warren Commission\u2019s integrity and soundness should be prioritized. \u201c[T]he charges of the critics are without serious foundation,\u201d the document reads, and \u201cfurther speculative discussion only plays in to the hands of the [Communist] opposition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The agency also directed its members \u201c[t]o employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>1035-960 further delineates specific techniques for countering \u201cconspiratorial\u201d arguments centering on the Warren Commission\u2019s findings. Such responses and their coupling with the pejorative label have been routinely wheeled out in various guises by corporate media outlets, commentators and political leaders to this day against those demanding truth and accountability about momentous public events.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No significant new evidence has emerged which the [Warren] Commission did not consider.<\/li>\n<li>Critics usually overvalue particular items and ignore others.<\/li>\n<li>Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>Critics have often been enticed by a form of intellectual pride: they light on some theory and fall in love with it.<\/li>\n<li>Oswald would not have been any sensible person\u2019s choice for a co-conspirator.<\/li>\n<li>Such vague accusations as that \u201cmore than ten people have died mysteriously\u201d [during the Warren Commission\u2019s inquiry] can always be explained in some natural way e.g.: the individuals concerned have for the most part died of natural causes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Today more so than ever news media personalities and commentators occupy powerful positions for initiating propaganda activities closely resembling those set out in 1035-960 against anyone who might question state-sanctioned narratives of controversial and poorly understood occurrences. Indeed, as the motives and methods encompassed in the document have become fully internalized by intellectual workers and operationalized through such media, the almost uniform public acceptance of official accounts concerning unresolved events such as the Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building bombing, 9\/11, and most recently the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, is largely guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>The effect on academic and journalistic inquiry into ambiguous and unexplained events that may in turn mobilize public inquiry, debate and action has been dramatic and far-reaching. One need only look to the rising police state and evisceration of civil liberties and constitutional protections as evidence of how this set of subtle and deceptive intimidation tactics has profoundly encumbered the potential for future independent self-determination and civic empowerment.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><div id=\"panel-657-0-0-2\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_black-studio-tinymce widget_black_studio_tinymce\" data-index=\"2\" ><h3 class=\"widget-title\">Don\u2019t Be Fooled By \u2018Conspiracy Theory\u2019 Smears<\/h3><div class=\"textwidget\"><h4><em><span style=\"color: #808080;\">from <\/span><\/em><a title=\"Washington's Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonsblog.com\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Washington's Blog<\/span><\/a><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">by <a title=\"Andrew Kreig\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonsblog.com\/author\/andrew-kreig\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Kreig<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">originally posted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonsblog.com\/2014\/05\/dont-fooled-conspiracy-theory-smears.html\" target=\"_blank\">May 28, 2014<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>CNN and Newsweek recently launched dubious tirades against what they called \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_660\" style=\"width: 230px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-660 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/DagHammarskjold.jpg\" alt=\"Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\" width=\"220\" height=\"185\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal published <a href=\"http:\/\/stream.wsj.com\/story\/latest-headlines\/SS-2-63399\/SS-2-534763\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>U.N.

Then it proceeded to assess various theories of President Kennedy\u2019s 1963 murder.<\/p>\n<p>By now, we know from declassified documents that the CIA undertook a massive secret campaign to smear critics of the Warren Commission with the label \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The campaign used members of mainstream media friendly to the CIA, for example, to discredit New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, shown below. Garrison was prosecuting New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw in what Garrison alleged was a conspiracy to murder Kennedy. Shaw, an OSS liaison to high-ranking British officials during World War II, founded a major regional trade mart in New Orleans shortly after the war. Garrison alleged that Shaw met with rightist opponents of JFK to plan the death.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_661\" style=\"width: 112px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-661 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/jim_garrison-102x150.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Garrison\" width=\"102\" height=\"150\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jim Garrison<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>A 50-page CIA memo, known as \u201cCIA Dispatch 1035-960,\u201d instructed agents to contact their media contacts and disparage those, like Garrison, criticizing the Warren Commission findings that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK and acted alone.

Tapper brought in a like-minded guest, Salon columnist Emily Bazelon, who relied on the same kind of seat-of-the-pants speculation to denounce protesters.<\/p>\n<p>Another example of selective analysis was a Newsweek cover story May 15, <em>The Plots to Destroy America<\/em>, written by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kurt_Eichenwald\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Eichenwald<\/a>. Oddly, Newsweek\u2019s sensationalistic title itself implied a conspiracy \u2014 that the diverse government critics on the right and left whom the magazine attacked intended to \u201cdestroy\u201d the nation with their \u201cplots.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I recognized the pattern. Three years ago, I hosted author Jonathan Kay on my weekly public affair radio show, Washington Update. Kay, a Canadian newspaper editor and law school graduate, had authored Among the Truthers, a 340-page book. Upon reading it, however, I saw that it raised alarm and mocked critics of 9\/11 official accounts but did not analyze their arguments.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Eichenwald cited as authority a handful of establishment \u201cexperts\u201d who mocked those who criticize government or other establishment institutions.<\/p>\n<p>Among the experts the Newsweek author repeatedly quoted was Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law professor, author of the recent book Conspiracy Theories, and a former high-ranking Obama administration official. During the Obama first term, Sunstein in effect oversaw all federal regulation at the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_662\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-662\" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/power_sunstein_biden-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Biden, Sunstein and Power\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samantha Power being sworn in by Joe Biden, with Cass Sunstein (center)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>A White House photo shows Sunstein with his wife, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, when Vice President Joe Biden swore her into office last summer. Her appointment followed her high-level work in national security at the White House and State Department during Obama\u2019s first term. As noted in my book, Presidential Puppetry, she is a leading proponent for regime change and military intervention globally on the grounds of humanitarian principles.<\/p>\n<p>Also last summer, Obama appointed Sunstein along with four others to the president\u2019s review commission for a response to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of massive illegal spying on the American public.<\/p>\n<p>Eichenwald glosses over this heavy national security background and the rhetoric needed to foster public support for global interventions.<\/p>\n<p>Even more relevant is that Eichenwald failed to note that Sunstein co-authored in 2008 what has become a notorious paper advocating propaganda techniques.<\/p>\n<p>In the paper \u201cConspiracy Theories,\u201d Sunstein advocated that the government secretly hire academics and journalists to thwart the dissemination of what federal authorities might regard as dangerous beliefs held by millions of voters, such as suggestion that officials were complicit in 9\/11 or a cover-up.<\/p>\n<p>Sunstein\u2019s own proposal sounds, in other words, like the kind of plot government critics most fear as a violation of constitutional rights by an Orwellian, Big Brother state.<\/p>\n<p>Yet Eichenwald argued that \u201cnot a scintilla of evidence\u201d exists for the theories he disparaged. He called them \u201cunsubstantiated nonsense.\u201d But he failed, like most with his mind-set, to refute the best arguments of his targets.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, he repeatedly cited well-credential experts, who applauded government officials for the most part and trivialized the concerns of complainers.<\/p>\n<p>Such elitist, slanted reporting by Newsweek and CNN suggests why their audiences are plunging and the outlets find themselves focused on half-truths important to someone, but not audiences. The Internet provides alternative news sources.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, the Washington Post sold Newsweek for just $1 and assumption of debts. The Post announced that it wanted to place the publication into the hands of a like-minded publisher. This was Sidney Harman, the husband of Congresswoman Jane Harman (D-CA), a Harvard Law grad and prominent advocate of the intelligence-military complex. Newsweek, much like CNN, retains only a shell of its former clout and has twice been sold since Sidney Harman died.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most of us still rely heavily on the mainstream media to complement our information from other sources.<\/p>\n<p>A striking example last week was a bold, exclusive report by Joe Lauria, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s United Nations correspondent.<\/p>\n<p>Lauria drew on his years on the beat to report for the Journal that the United Nations may reactivate on the basis of new evidence its dormant inquiry on whether its late leader, Hammarskj\u00f6ld, was intentionally killed during his 1961 peace-keeping mission.<\/p>\n<p>As a former stringer for the Journal for two years earlier in my career, I can imagine how much research the reporter must have produced before such a story would make it into print. His achievement is especially striking at a Murdoch-owned paper, whose owner is better known for benefiting from high-level intrigues than exposing them.<\/p>\n<p>And what if the United Nations proceeds \u2014 and finds that the secretary-general died from foul play?<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, that would not be good news for those who deny conspiracies. But they would surely find a way to avoid in-depth reporting.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><em>Cross-posted with additional reference materials at Justice Integrity Project (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.justice-integrity.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.justice-integrity.org<\/a>)<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><div id=\"panel-657-0-0-3\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_black-studio-tinymce widget_black_studio_tinymce\" data-index=\"3\" ><h3 class=\"widget-title\">Cracking The \u201cConspiracy Theories\u2019\u201d Psycholinguistic Code: The Witch Hunt against Independent Research and Analysis<\/h3><div class=\"textwidget\"><h4><em><span style=\"color: #808080;\">from <\/span><\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalresearch.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Global Research <\/span><\/a><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalresearch.ca\/author\/james-f-tracy\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. James F.

This March saw the release of \u201ccognitive infiltration\u201d advocate Cass Sunstein\u2019s new book, Conspiracy Theories and Other Dangerous Ideas. In April, the confirmed federal intelligence-gathering arm, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), released a new report, \u201cAgenda 21: The UN, Sustainability, and Right Wing Conspiracy Theory.\u201d Most recently, Newsweek magazine carried a cover story, titled, \u201cThe Plots to Destroy America: Conspiracy Theories Are a Clear and Present Danger.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As its discourse suggests, this propaganda campaign is using the now familiar \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d label, as outlined in Central Intelligence Agency Document 1035-960, the 1967 memo laying out a strategy for CIA \u201cmedia assets\u201d to counter criticism of the Warren Commission and attack independent investigators of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. At that time the targets included attorney Mark Lane and New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who were routinely defamed and lampooned in major US news outlets.<\/p>\n<p>Declassified government documents have proven Lane and Garrison\u2019s allegations of CIA-involvement in the assassination largely accurate. Nevertheless, the prospect of being subject to the conspiracy theorist smear remains a potent weapon for intimidating authors, journalists, and scholars from interrogating complex events, policies, and other potentially controversial subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>As the title of Newsweek\u2019s feature story indicates, a primary element of contemporary propaganda campaigns using the conspiracy theory\/ist label is to suggest that citizens\u2019 distrust of government imperatives and activities tends toward violent action. The \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d term is intentionally conflated with \u201cconspiracist,\u201d thus linking the two in the mass mind. Images of Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh, and Osama bin Laden are subtly invoked when the magic terms are referenced. In reality, it is typically Western governments using their police or military who prove the foremost purveyors of violence and the threat of violence\u2014both domestically and abroad.<\/p>\n<p>In his Newsweek article, author and journalist Kurt Eichenwald selectively employs the assertions of the SPLC, Sunstein, and a handful of social scientists to postulate in Orwellian fashion that independent research and analysis of the United Nations\u2019 Agenda 21, the anti-educational thrust of \u201cCommon Core,\u201d the dangers of vaccine injury and water fluoridation, and September 11\u2014all important policies and issues worthy of serious study and concern\u2014are a \u201ccontagion\u201d to the body politic.<\/p>\n<p>In a functioning public, honest academics and journalists would uninhibitedly delve into these and similar problems\u2013GMOs, state-sponsored terrorism, the dangers of non-ionizing radiation\u2013 particularly since such phenomena pose grave threats to both popular sovereignty and self determination. Such intellectuals would then provide important findings to foster vigorous public debate.<\/p>\n<p>Absent this, segments of the populace still capable of critical thought are inclined to access and probe information that leads them to question bureaucratic edicts and, in some cases, suggest a potentially broader political agenda. In today\u2019s world, however, such research projects carried out by the hoi polloi that are expressly reserved for government or foundation-funded technocrats \u201c\u2019distort the debate that is crucial to democracy,\u2019\u201d says Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan.<\/p>\n<p>With the above in mind, a simple yet instructive exercise in illustrating the psycholinguistic feature of the conspiracy theory propaganda technique is to replace \u201cconspiracy theories\/ists\u201d with the phrase, \u201cindependent research and analysis,\u201d or \u201cindependent researchers.\u201d Let us apply this to some passages from Eichenwald\u2019s recent Newsweek piece.<\/p>\n<p>For example, \u201cPsychological research has shown that the only trait that consistently indicates the probability someone will believe in <del>conspiracy theories<\/del> independent research and analysis is if that person believes in other <del>conspiracy theories<\/del> independent research and analysis,\u201d Eichenwald sagely concludes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most common ways of introducing <del>conspiracy theories<\/del> independent research and analysis is to \u2018just ask questions\u2019 about an official account,\u2019\u2019\u2019 says Karen Douglas, co-editor of the British Journal of Social Psychology and a senior academic \u2026 at Britain\u2019s University of Kent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, substituting the phrases accordingly throughout the article significantly neutralizes its overall propagandistic effect.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers agree; independent research and analysis are espoused by people at every level of society seeking ways of calming the chaos of life, sometimes by simply reinforcing convictions.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_665\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665\" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/911conspiracy-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"9\/11 conspiracy theorists independent researchers protest outside the World Trade Center in 2011\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">9\/11 <del>conspiracy theorists<\/del> independent researchers protest outside the World Trade Center in 2011<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While the growth in the number of news outlets has helped spread independent research and analysis, it doesn\u2019t compare to the impact of social media and the Internet, experts say.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you have social networks of people who are talking with one another, you can have independent research and analysis spread in a hurry,\u2019\u2019 says Cass Sunstein, a professor at Harvard Law School \u2026 \u201cIt literally is as if it was contagious.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While some may dismiss independent researchers as ignorant or unstable, research has shown that to be false. \u201cThe idea that only dumb people believe this stuff is wrong,\u2019\u2019 says Dartmouth\u2019s Nyhan.<\/p>\n<p>People who more strongly believed in independent research and analysis were significantly less likely to use sunscreen or have an annual medical checkup.<\/p>\n<p>According to a just-released report from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the independent research and analysis flowed in April at a hearing before Alabama\u2019s Senate Education Committee about legislation to allow school districts to reject Common Core.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s true. Since September 11, 2001 the internet has increasingly allowed for everyday people to retrieve, study, and share information on important events and phenomena as never before. And as a recent study published in the prominent journal Frontiers of Psychology suggests, tendering \u201calternative conspiracy theories\u201d to the government-endorsed explanations of September 11, 2001 is a sign of \u201cindividuation,\u201d or psychological well being and contentment.<\/p>\n<p>Such a condition is a clear danger to those who wish to wield uncontested political authority. Indeed, the capacity to freely disseminate and discuss knowledge of government malfeasance is the foremost counterbalance to tyranny. Since this ability cannot be readily confiscated or suppressed, it must be ridiculed, marginalized, even diagnosed as a psychiatric condition.<\/p>\n<p>The recent abandonment of network neutrality may eventually further subdue the nuisance of independent research, thought, and analysis. Until then, the corporate media\u2019s attempts to bamboozle and terrify the American public with the well-worn conspiracy theory meme will be a prevalent feature of what passes for news and commentary today.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0 <\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><div id=\"panel-657-0-0-4\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_headline-widget\" data-index=\"4\" >\t\t<h1>CIA Document 1035-960<\/h1>\n\t\t<div class=\"decoration\"><div class=\"decoration-inside\"><\/div><\/div>\n\t\t<h3><\/h3>\n\t\t<\/div><div id=\"panel-657-0-0-5\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_black-studio-tinymce widget_black_studio_tinymce panel-last-child\" data-index=\"5\" ><div class=\"panel-widget-style panel-widget-style-for-657-0-0-5\" ><div class=\"textwidget\"><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-669 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/200px-CIA.svg_-150x150.png\" alt=\"200px-CIA.svg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>1967<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">CIA Document 1035-960<\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><strong>1. Our Concern.<\/strong> From the day of President Kennedy's assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility for his murder. Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report, (which appeared at the end of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the Commission's published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission's report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought that the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse results.<\/p>\n<p>2. This trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S. government, including our organization. The members of the Warren Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the country. Just because of the standing of the Commissioners, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society. Moreover, there seems to be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself, as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some way responsible for the assassination.<\/p>\n<p>Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.<\/p>\n<p>3. Action. We do not recommend that discussion of the assassination question be initiated where it is not already taking place. Where discussion is active [business] addresses are requested:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">a. To discuss the publicity problem with [?] and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">b. To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passing to assets. Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (I) politically interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories. In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing that Epstein's and comes off badly where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)<\/p>\n<p>4. In private to media discussions not directed at any particular writer, or in attacking publications which may be yet forthcoming, the following arguments should be useful:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">a. No significant new evidence has emerged which the Commission did not consider. The assassination is sometimes compared (e.g., by Joachim Joesten and Bertrand Russell) with the Dreyfus case; however, unlike that case, the attack on the Warren Commission have produced no new evidence, no new culprits have been convincingly identified, and there is no agreement among the critics. (A better parallel, though an imperfect one, might be with the Reichstag fire of 1933, which some competent historians (Fritz Tobias, AJ.P. Taylor, D.C. Watt) now believe was set by Vander Lubbe on his own initiative, without acting for either Nazis or Communists; the Nazis tried to pin the blame on the Communists, but the latter have been more successful in convincing the world that the Nazis were to blame.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">b. Critics usually overvalue particular items and ignore others. They tend to place more emphasis on the recollections of individual witnesses (which are less reliable and more divergent--and hence offer more hand-holds for criticism) and less on ballistics, autopsy, and photographic evidence. A close examination of the Commission's records will usually show that the conflicting eyewitness accounts are quoted out of context, or were discarded by the Commission for good and sufficient reason.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">c. Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States, esp. since informants could expect to receive large royalties, etc. Note that Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time and John F. Kennedy's brother, would be the last man to overlook or conceal any conspiracy. And as one reviewer pointed out, Congressman Gerald R. Ford would hardly have held his tongue for the sake of the Democratic administration, and Senator Russell would have had every political interest in exposing any misdeeds on the part of Chief Justice Warren. A conspirator moreover would hardly choose a location for a shooting where so much depended on conditions beyond his control: the route, the speed of the cars, the moving target, the risk that the assassin would be discovered. A group of wealthy conspirators could have arranged much more secure conditions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">d. Critics have often been enticed by a form of intellectual pride: they light on some theory and fall in love with it; they also scoff at the Commission because it did not always answer every question with a flat decision one way or the other. Actually, the make-up of the Commission and its staff was an excellent safeguard against over-commitment to any one theory, or against the illicit transformation of probabilities into certainties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">e. Oswald would not have been any sensible person's choice for a co-conspirator. He was a \"loner,\" mixed up, of questionable reliability and an unknown quantity to any professional intelligence service.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">f. As to charges that the Commission's report was a rush job, it emerged three months after the deadline originally set. But to the degree that the Commission tried to speed up its reporting, this was largely due to the pressure of irresponsible speculation already appearing, in some cases coming from the same critics who, refusing to admit their errors, are now putting out new criticisms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">g. Such vague accusations as that \"more than ten people have died mysteriously\" can always be explained in some natural way e.g.: the individuals concerned have for the most part died of natural causes; the Commission staff questioned 418 witnesses (the FBI interviewed far more people, conduction 25,000 interviews and re interviews), and in such a large group, a certain number of deaths are to be expected. (When Penn Jones, one of the originators of the \"ten mysterious deaths\" line, appeared on television, it emerged that two of the deaths on his list were from heart attacks, one from cancer, one was from a head-on collision on a bridge, and one occurred when a driver drifted into a bridge abutment.)<\/p>\n<p>5. Where possible, counter speculation by encouraging reference to the Commission's Report itself. Open-minded foreign readers should still be impressed by the care, thoroughness, objectivity and speed with which the Commission worked.

In this article (republished below in its entirety) Swanson asks a question which is central to our project: &#8220;What if the unspeakable were made speakable?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/davidswanson.org\/node\/4593\"><em>Mark Udall and the Unspeakable<\/em><\/a> by David Swanson | originally posted November 20, 2014<\/p>\n<p>President Obama, who is just now un-ending again the ending of the endless war on Afghanistan, has never made a secret of taking direction from the military, CIA, and NSA. He&#8217;s escalated wars that generals had publicly insisted he escalate. He&#8217;s committed to not prosecuting torturers after seven former heads of the CIA publicly told him not to. He&#8217;s gone after whistleblowers with a vengeance and is struggling to keep this Bush-era torture report, or parts of it, secret in a manner that should confuse his partisan supporters.<\/p>\n<p>But the depth of elected officials&#8217; obedience to a permanent war machine is usually a topic avoided in polite company &#8212; usually, not always. Back in 2011, the dean of the law school at UC Berkeley, a member of Obama&#8217;s transition team in 2009, <a href=\"http:\/\/davidswanson.org\/node\/3390\">said<\/a> publicly that Obama had decided in 2009 to block prosecutions of Bush-era criminals in part because the CIA, NSA, and military would revolt. Ray McGovern says he has a trustworthy witness to Obama saying he would leave the crimes unpunished because, in Obama&#8217;s words, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what happened to Martin Luther King?&#8221; Neither of those incidents has interested major media outlets in the slightest.<\/p>\n<p>As we pass the 51st anniversary of the murder of President John F. Kennedy, <a href=\"http:\/\/releasethetorturereport.com\/?code=RootsAction\">many of us are urging<\/a> Senator Mark Udall to make the torture report public by placing it into the Congressional Record, as Senator Mike Gravel did with the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Gravel is alive and well, and there&#8217;s every reason to believe that Udall would go on to live many years deeply appreciated for his action. But there is &#8212; let us be honest for a moment &#8212; a reason Udall might hesitate that we don&#8217;t want to speak about.<\/p>\n<p>The general thinking is that because Udall&#8217;s term ends this month, he doesn&#8217;t have to please those who fund his election campaigns through the U.S. system of legalized bribery, and he doesn&#8217;t have to please his fellow corrupt senators because he won&#8217;t be working with them any longer. Both of those points may be false. Udall may intend to run for the Senate again, or &#8212; like most senators, I suspect &#8212; he may secretly plan on running for president some day. And the big payoffs for elected officials who work to please plutocracy always come after they leave office. But there is another consideration. The need to please the permanent war machine ends only when one is willing to die for something &#8212; what Dr. King said one must be willing to do to have a life worth living &#8212; not when one leaves office.<\/p>\n<p>Presidents and Congress members send large numbers of people to risk their lives murdering much larger numbers of people in wars all the time. They have taken on jobs &#8212; particularly the presidency &#8212; in which they know they will be in danger no matter what they do.\u00a0 And yet everyone in Washington knows (and no one says) that making an enemy of the CIA is just not done and has not been done since the last man to do it died in a convertible in Dallas. We&#8217;ve seen progressive members of Congress like Dennis Kucinich leave without putting crucial documents that they thought should be public into the Congressional Record. Any member of Congress, newly reelected or not, could give the public the torture report. A group of 10 of them could do it collectively for the good of humanity. But nobody thinks they will. Challenging a president who does not challenge the CIA is just not something that&#8217;s done.<\/p>\n<p>To understand why, I recommend reading Jim Douglass&#8217; book <em>JFK and the Unspeakable<\/em>. Douglass is currently writing about three other murders, those of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy. Distant history? Something that doesn&#8217;t happen anymore? Perhaps, but is that because we&#8217;ve run out of lone nuts with guns? Clearly not. Is it because the permanent war machine has stopped killing its enemies? Or is it, rather, because no one has presented the same challenge to the permanent war machine that those people did? Peace voices are no longer allowed in the U.S. media. Both political parties favor widespread war. War has become a matter of routine. Enforcement has become unnecessary, because the threat, or other influences that align with it, has been so successful.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend checking out ProjectUnspeakable.com, the website of a play by Court Dorsey that recounts the killing of JFK, Malcolm, Martin, and RFK. (Or check out a <a href=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/events\/upcoming-events\/\">performance<\/a> in Harlem planned for February 21.)<\/p>\n<p>The play consists almost entirely of actual quotes by public figures. While no attempt is made, of course, at including a comprehensive collection of information, enough evidence is included in the play to completely erase belief in the official stories of how those four men died. And evidence is included showing who actually killed them, how, and why.<\/p>\n<p>As if that weren&#8217;t enough to persuade the viewer that our society is mentally blocking out something uncomfortable, the glaring obviousness of what happened in those years of assassinations is highlighted. President Kennedy was publicly asked if he might be murdered exactly as he was, and he publicly replied that it could certainly happen. His brother discussed the likelihood of it with Khrushchev for godsake. The killing of Malcolm X was not the war machine&#8217;s first attempt on his life. He and King both saw what was coming quite clearly and said so. Bobby Kennedy knew too, did not believe the official account of his brother&#8217;s murder. King&#8217;s family rejects the claim that James Earl Ray killed MLK, pointing instead to the CIA killer shown in the photographs of the assassination but never questioned as a witness. A jury has unanimously agreed with King&#8217;s family against the government and the history books.<\/p>\n<p>The attention to President Kennedy has always been so intense that fear and suppression have been required. The doctors said he was shot from the front. Everyone agreed there were more bullets shot than left the gun of the official suspect, who was positioned behind the target. But investigators and witnesses have died in very suspect circumstances. The other deaths have not been in exactly the same glaring spotlight. New evidence in the killing of Robert Kennedy emerges every few years and is chatted about as a curiosity for a moment before simply being ignored. After all, the man is dead.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s try an analogy. I live in Charlottesville, Va., where the University of Virginia is. This week, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/features\/a-rape-on-campus-20141119\">Rolling Stone<\/a><\/em> published an article about violent gang rapes of female students in a fraternity house. I had known that rape victims are often reluctant to come forward. I had known that rape can be a hard charge to prove. But I had also known that young women sometimes regret sex and falsely accuse nonviolent well-meaning young men of rape, and that UVA held rallies against date rape, and that opposition to sexual assault and harassment was all over the news and widely accepted as the proper progressive position. With California passing a law to clarify what consent is, I had assumed everyone knew <em>violent assault<\/em> had nothing to do with consent. I had assumed brutal gang attacks by students who are expelled if they cheat on a test or write a bad check could not go unknown. And now it seems there&#8217;s something of a widely known unspoken epidemic. In the analysis of the <em>Rolling Stone<\/em> article, women deny rape goes on to shield themselves from the fear, while men deny it in order to shield themselves from any discomfort about their party-going fun-loving carelessness. And yet some significant number of students knew and stayed silent until one brave victim spoke, just as every whistleblower in Washington exists alongside thousands of people who keep their mouths shut.<\/p>\n<p>What if someone in Washington were to speak? What if the unspeakable were made speakable?<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><strong>David Swanson<\/strong> is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

This is the most important trial of the 20th century, and yet most people have never heard of it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In May of this year Randy Kehler, Project Director of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/\">Project Unspeakable<\/a>, wrote about <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Trauma, Truth, and Healing<\/span>.\u00a0 He framed the dynamic of understanding our collective history so that some measure of closure and healing can finally happen:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s an accepted fact that the murder of a family member is a traumatic event for the rest of the family, collectively and individually. When the identity of the people responsible for the murder and the reasons for it are still in doubt, it is even more traumatic. Only when the true, indisputable facts of the murder are finally revealed, can there be the kind of closure that allows genuine healing to take place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This reality is no less applicable when the \u201cfamily\u201d is the people of a nation. In this light, it\u2019s easy to see why the 1960\u2019s assassinations of JKF, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Bobby Kennedy were deeply traumatic events for the millions of people who loved and admired some or all of these men. Because the truth about why these four leaders were killed and the role of individuals within our own government in engineering their assassination has long been covered up, denied, and made \u201cunspeakable,\u201d closure and healing have never been possible.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet Project Unspeakable is not about blame or punishment.\u00a0 Rather, it\u2019s an attempt, through the use of live theater, to not only bring forth the inspiring visions of these four leaders, but also to uncover and bring to greater public awareness the essential truth about their assassinations so that some measure of closure and healing can finally happen.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, we also hope to raise questions and consciousness about, and thus help put an end to, the many covered up, denied, and \u201cunspeakable\u201d crimes of state occurring today.\u00a0 Doing so would mark a enormously positive step toward creating a government that is far more truthful, transparent, and democratically accountable than the one we have now.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is life-giving and life-affirming to learn about and understand such critical facts to increase awareness of our world and provide a more holistic view of our time.

Throughout the civil rights movement this man\u2019s voice, power and strength propelled the creation of a new world that united the vast populations of colored people as well as provided prospects of a bright future. These words were strong and created a movement. For the hands in power, MLK created everything they ever feared. With colored communities in an uproar for equal rights, on Nov. 18, 1964, MLK received an anonymous letter threatening him and requesting him to stop his civil rights work or the author would reveal the \u201csinful\u201d double sided life he led.<\/p>\n<p>Laced with hate, some lines from the letter read, \u201cYou are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that.\u201d The word \u201cevil\u201d makes six appearances in the text, which writes about alleged lovers, carnal rage and personal betrayal.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. received this letter he quietly informed friends that someone wanted to kill him\u2014 and he thought he knew who that someone was. The F.B.I.\u2019s infamous director, J. Edgar Hoover, made no secret of his desire to see King discredited and Dr. King had no problem assuming the letter from him. A little more than a decade later, the Senate\u2019s Church Committee on intelligence overreach confirmed King\u2019s suspicion. When the letter was received by Dr. King it got very little coverage and most people didn\u2019t even know it existed; now it occupies a unique place in the history of American intelligence, highlighting the Bureau\u2019s capacity to do wrong.<\/p>\n<p>This story brings light to the ongoing debate over how much the government should know about our private lives. Should intelligence agencies be able to sweep our email? Read our texts? Track our phone calls? and locate us by GPS? Much of the conversation swirls around the possibility that agencies like the N.S.A. or the F.B.I. will use such information not to serve national security but to carry out personal and political vendettas. Dr. King\u2019s experiences remind us of the not-so-idle fears that some in power have of civil rights, and the lengths government leaders may go to, to try and ensure that civilians remain unresponsive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Read more on the letter at <a href=\"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1pMgTP8\">http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1pMgTP8<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The facts are in our history.

The aromatic sizzle that sells the hearty steak. The action-packed trailer that lures you to the blockbuster movie. But in reality it\u2019s more like the aggressive perfume sprayers in department stores that deaden your senses with a cloud of acrid stench leaving you blinded and dazed. The election season highlights not our dedicated patriots vying to improve the country, but the greedy villains who are subtly but devastatingly destroying the democratic process like a creeping and relentless rust. In addition to hunting those home-grown terrorists sneaking over to Syria to join ISIS, we should also be rooting out the saboteurs amongst us who are doing greater damage. While the culprits are pointing and shouting, \u201cHey, look over there! We\u2019re under attack by Ebola and ISIS,\u201d<\/p>\n<p>they are brutally clubbing the baby seal of the democratic principle. We can\u2019t keep touting our political system as a model for the world while tolerating the worst kind of bad actors whose actions slowly grind away our system. We shouldn\u2019t just shrug it off with cynical acceptance, \u201cThat\u2019s politics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of that line from a Brenda Shaughnessy poem, \u201cIt\u2019s like having a bad boyfriend in a good band.\u201d The good band is the democratic system; the bad boyfriend is the abusive politician willing to compromise that system to satisfy his own lust for power. The two most egregious examples of this betrayal are in misleading political ads and in partisan lawmaking that is meant to obstruct fair voting practices. The first attempts to misinform the public, inhibiting its ability to make an informed choice. The second attempts to obstruct eligible voters from casting their ballot because they might not vote the way those in power want them to vote&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>What should we do to protect democracy against these saboteurs from within?.. We need to do two things to stabilize the listing ship of democracy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, scrape off the barnacles. In this case, the barnacles are those who would pass laws deliberately restricting voters from voting. We have to join together on principle and vote out such sinister people, even if these voting restrictions benefit your party. Because this isn\u2019t about giving your party more power, it\u2019s about having a party that supports the democratic ideals of the Constitution. We certainly shouldn\u2019t be doing away with &#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Next, laws against false political ads; we should be enacting more such laws and enforcing them more diligently. These laws should include punishments that range from assessing huge fines capable of crippling a campaign to prison. Do those punishments really seem too steep for someone destroying the democratic process?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Instead, of spouting grimly sophisticated cynicism of pundits, I still believe that the inherent goodness of the process can defeat the greed of the politically ambitious and ethically vacuous. Maybe I\u2019m just saying that even one lying political ad is \u201cone too many.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>COMMENTARY BY MARLENE BUCHANAN, PROJECT UNSPEAKABLE OUTREACH ASSOCIATE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The article above has more relevancy to Project Unspeakable than is immediately apparent. Mr. Abdul-Jabbar wants there to be more active participation in maintaining democracy by the general citizenry. He rails against the apathy that labels false political ads merely as \u201cThat&#8217;s Politics,\u201d and shines a laser light on the degrading of democratic ideals by \u201cthe greedy villains\u201d in politics. Project Unspeakable wants also to see an informed and activated populace which defends our democratic ideals and demands that our governments, be they local, state or federal, act in accordance with the Constitution and provide equal protection for all who live here.<\/p>\n<p>We offer information about the connections between shady, oppressive government activities in the 1960s, the four assassinations and their connections to similar shadowy, abuse-of-power activities still persisting today. Together, we can say a resounding No, to pervasive and invasive covert surveillance by \u201cbig Brother\u201d as well as to \u201cBig Business\u201d that purchases our politicians as proxies for enacting or repealing laws that favor corporations over people. We can stand together and refuse to allow the rape-for-profit of fellow-citizens, of our environment and of the futures of our children and grandchildren. We, as informed, educated and just people, must see to it that the enthusiastic militarizing of local police forces is reversed (why do we need to recreate local militias from colonial times just to enrich the military industries?) An active and persistent citizenry will keep scuzzy politicians in check on all fronts, as well as serving to demonstrate that we can and will &#8216;walk the talk&#8217; of democracy in this nation and thus become a better exemplar for other countries. Whereas Kareem Abdul-Jabbar employed the written words above, excerpted from his article in TIME, to rouse us to action, Project Unspeakable utilizes words in a different formulation.

Kennedy\u2019s assassination, let\u2019s reflect on some of the things he said. The following are either direct quotes, or are quotes reportedly said by reputable sources that were there when he said them. They are all quotes from the play <em>Project Unspeakable. <\/em>The annotated version of the script (available on request) has the citations for each quote. (They may be collapsed, shortened or slightly re-arranged.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One summer weekend in 1962, while out sailing with friends, Kennedy was asked what he thought of <em>Seven Days in May<\/em>, a best-selling novel that described a military take-over in the United States. He said: &#8220;It\u2019s possible. It could happen in this country, but the conditions would have to be just right. If, for example, the country had a young President, and he had a Bay of Pigs, there would be a certain uneasiness. Maybe the military would do a little criticizing behind his back, but this would be written off as the usual military dissatisfaction with civilian control. Then if there were another Bay of Pigs, the reaction of the country would be, \u201cis he too young and inexperienced?\u201d The military would almost feel that it was their patriotic obligation to stand ready to preserve the integrity of the nation. Then, if there were a third Bay of Pigs, it could happen. But it won\u2019t happen on my watch&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During the first (actual) Bay of Pigs, a CIA-planned attack on Cuba that Kennedy inherited when he became President, he said, &#8220;We\u2019re not going to plunge into an irresponsible action just because a fanatical fringe in this country puts so-called national pride above national reason&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And following the Bay of Pigs, &#8220;I want to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, there\u2019s one Bay of Pigs. JFK had initiated a secret dialogue with Nikita Khrushchev, the Premier of the Soviet Union, with whom the U.S. was fighting the Cold War. This correspondence must be kept wholly private, not to be hinted at in public statements, much less disclosed to the press, to give us a chance to address each other in frank, realistic and fundamental terms. I like very much your analogy of Noah\u2019s Ark. Therefore, I am trying to penetrate our ideological differences in order to find some bridge across the gulf on which we could bring our minds together and find some way in which to protect the peace of the world.<\/p>\n<p>During the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union had a very dangerous nuclear face-off, JFK\u2019s brother and Attorney General, Robert, approached the Soviets saying, &#8220;The President is in a grave situation. We are under very severe stress. We are under pressure from our military to use force against Cuba. That is why the President is appealing directly to Chairman Khrushchev for his help in liquidating this conflict. If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Is JFK\u2019s response to the Cuban Missile Crisis not a second Bay of Pigs?<\/p>\n<p>Then, on June 10, 1963, at a commencement address at American University, Kennedy publicly challenged the very underpinnings of the Cold War.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn. We are devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to combat ignorance, poverty, and disease. Let us not be blind to our differences \u2013 but let us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which those differences can be resolved.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those not yet convinced that JFK had indeed committed this so-called \u201cthird\u201d Bay of Pigs, consider this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We can\u2019t embrace every tinhorn dictator who tells us he\u2019s anti-Communist while he\u2019s sitting on the necks of his own people. And the United States government is not the representative of private business. Do you know in Chile the American copper companies control about 80% of all the foreign exchange? We wouldn\u2019t stand for that here. And there\u2019s no reason they should stand for it. There\u2019s a revolution going on down there, and I want to be on right side of it. Hell, we are on the right side. But we have to let them know it, that things have changed&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On this anniversary of his assassination, let\u2019s consider one other quote:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie \u2013deliberate, contrived and dishonest \u2013 but the myth \u2013 persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;<em>Court Dorsey<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_545\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/warren.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-545 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/warren-300x209.jpg\" alt=\"warren\" width=\"300\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/warren-300x209.jpg 300w, http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/warren-150x104.jpg 150w, http:\/\/projectunspeakable.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/warren.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Warren Commission delivers its report on Kennedy&#8217;s assassination to President Lyndon B.
