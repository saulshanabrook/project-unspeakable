		<description><![CDATA[I hope that you will include  a story  on the massacre of Pan Am Flight #103 Lockerbie, Scotland which took my brother&#039;s and 269 others lives on December 21 1988. Despite my meetings with former Sec. State Albright, former Nat. Sec. Adviser Sandy Berger, and former USA Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson and countless other functionaries of The Government, I do not trust that only War Criminal &quot;Colonel&quot; Gadaffi and only two indicted suspects Lamen Kalifah Fimah  and Abdel Bassett Ali Megrahi were to blame-we know from court records that the State Dept. told personnel not to take that flight since there was an high level threat on that flight, and this is because it was the 8th day of Hannakah and 4 days before Christmas  in the West.
   I would also like a story about  to know if former  Gov. of NJ Whitman had CIA reportage when she was EPA Director and told people to go back to work despite there being cancer causing elements in the air at Ground Zero.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article.  It&#039;s also important to recognize that one of the tactics the apologists use is to highlight (or create) fake claims of conspiracy to discredit.   Disinformation is an important tool of ridicule.  For example, Sunstein has written, paranthetically, about the claim a plane didn&#039;t hit the Pentagon, shrewdly noting that some of us recognize this was a clever hoax, but he ignores how warnings the attacks were imminent were deliberately suppressed.

With the coup against JFK, there&#039;s many false claims sprinkled among the real evidence.  This makes it more difficult to notice that obvious -- JFK&#039;s removal from office was due to significant policy disputes with the military industrial complex.

The binary approach that there&#039;s the official story vs. the counter claim is insufficient.   There&#039;s a variety of fall back positions and discrediting disinformation to create confusion.]]></description>
